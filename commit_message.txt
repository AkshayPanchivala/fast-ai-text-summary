feat: Improve build script cross-platform compatibility and update version

Replaced Windows-specific `rmdir` commands in `build` and `prepublishOnly` scripts with `rimraf` for better cross-platform compatibility.
Installed `rimraf` as a dev dependency.
Updated package version to 2.1.1.

This resolves the build failure on Unix-like systems caused by the `rmdir` command.
The `glob` and `inflight` deprecation warnings remain as they are from deeply nested transitive dependencies.
